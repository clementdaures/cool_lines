**About**  
Cool Lines is an intuitive tool for creating and managing stylized lines directly in Maya.  
It allows artists to paint lines on meshes, generate lines from edges, assign preview shaders, and bake lines into the scene.  

Key features include:  
- Paint lines directly on a target mesh using Maya Paint Effects tools  
- Generate lines from mesh edges automatically  
- Assign a default preview shader to all lines  
- Control line scale, resolution, and taper via a simple UI  
- Dockable interface with live updates on scene changes  
- Bake all lines into a single group for final scene export  

Cool Lines is fully built using PySide2/PySide6, depending on your Maya version, and is compatible with Maya (2023+)
